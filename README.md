# FaceTheMusic
Fred Harris Fan Club's interesting attempt at using machine learning to build an app. Built for the 2018 Reno Hackathon.
This project uses Microsoft Azure REST APIs in an application that takes a picture of the user using a webcam in order to determine a song to be played based on the facial expression of the people in the picture.
